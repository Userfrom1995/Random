"""M8 calibration (plan section 7, spec-v1.md s3/s6).

Three calibration instruments, all as DATA plus pure analysis:

1. Warmup sensitivity curve: the 30 s provisional warmup is proven, not
   asserted. The curve runs one geometry (M1-1 select-only, direct arm)
   at each candidate warmup with fixed 60 s measure and 3 paired
   repeats, then ``evaluate_warmup_curve`` picks the smallest warmup
   whose median tps sits within tolerance of the best observed median.
   If no candidate reaches tolerance, warmup rises (the decision rule
   returns sufficient=False with the required next candidate).
2. Scale-100 pilot: scale 100 becomes first-class, not nightly-only.
   Pilot cells twin two M1 geometries at ``-s 100`` (10M accounts,
   roughly 1.5 GB) with standard timing; the full scale-100 matrix
   joins the M9 resweep only after the pilot proves the iron holds it.
3. Workload breadth + fixed-offer registry readout for the M9 matrix
   (definitions live in ``workloads.py``; this module publishes the
   calibration budget that covers them).

This module never runs pgbench itself; the M9 sweep executes the
specs it publishes. No procedure branches live here.
