"""M6 auth-posture labels + equalized-auth churn control (plan 9.1).

Current churn cells mix frontend postures: SCRAM (PgBouncer, pgagroal,
pgcat) against ``none`` (Odyssey frontend) and disabled HBA (pgpool-II).
Those recorded-asymmetric arms stay labeled and stay in the matrix; the
equalized-auth control defined here runs beside them (M9) so churn
deltas measure multiplexing, not auth cost.

This module is DATA + labels only. No procedure branches live here.
